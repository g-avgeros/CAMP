# CAMPDB - Booking Management System
A company that operates in the tourism industry has a significant number
camps in our country. The company is mainly aimed at groups of tourists
but also to individual tourists who wish to camp in an area
of our country during their holidays.

# Goal
The company kept all the bookings in an excel file along with the details of the customers and its camps. We created a normalized database 
in the 3rd norm, so that the information is immediately available from the company's systems and reducing the redundant information.
Additionally, we created a data warehouse so that the company can analyze its data for better decision making.
